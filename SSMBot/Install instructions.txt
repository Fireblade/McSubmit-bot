//////////////////////////////
First time setup requirements.

1: Create a new twitch account with a name that you want your bot to have. (or you can use your own account, i don't recommend)
2: go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ and get a oauth code for your bot. (Don't share this with anyone else!)
3: Run the bot once to generate your config.cfg file, 
4: Set the g_bot_name to the name of your bot. Preffered all lower case.
5: Set the g_bot_chan to the channel name that you wish your bot to work under. Include a hashtag infront. (#)
6: set the g_bot_oauth to the code password that you got in step 2. (Don't share oauth!!)
7: in the channels.txt file, change line 1 to be the same channel as in step 5. Do not put a hashtag infront. (#)
8: Ready to go, start bot and see if !submit works.

9: If you want to use the chat commands of !next and !random, Add yourself as a moderator in the moderators.txt file. 
(required if you do not use the GUI)


Optional:
Set response's in the responses.cfg file
Set other config options as necesary. 
Set your bot as a mod. (so he does't get timed out from your other bots! 100% optional though!)


/////////////////////////////
Google spreadsheets and forms.
1: Create a new spreadsheet. (google sheet)
2: Insert new form
3: In the form add a field for a level field, and author (submitter)
4: optional - create a new sheet with level,author,time,deaths. (completed levels list)
5: go back to the sheet results, at the bottom left click your form sheets (should be named form responses)
6: new tab called form, go to live form.
7: Save that url at the end of g_forms_url= and g_forms_completed_url=. Replace the /viewform with /viewResponse
7b: example>> g_forms_completed_url=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/xyzrandomletters/formResponse
8: right-click the text field for each element you created, and click inspect (or inspect element)
9: for each element created you will find something related to "entry_########", Save that in the config file.
9b: examples: g_forms_completed_submit_entry=entry_150396879, g_forms_completed_level_entry=entry_200666383
10: turn the forms_use=true to enable.

if you don't want a death, or a timer, or both added to the completion spreadsheet, I have not tested this but...
i think if you leave the timer/death field empty, and have it on your form as "optional" then it will leave it blank/skip.

This link may help you figure out how to get your entry codes.
